# Thesis Project Repository

This repository contains the data and code used in my thesis on HVAC energy consumption analysis. It includes both Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks which utilize datasets to perform various analyses and visualizations.

## Data Source

The CSV files used in this project are sourced from an open dataset available on Figshare. These files contain data from a study on a multizone office building under different fault types and intensities, collected under various outdoor conditions.

- **Data Source:** [Datasets of a Multizone Office Building with Different Fault Types and Intensities under the Different Outdoor Conditions](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Datasets_of_a_Multizone_Office_Building_with_Different_Fault_Types_and_Intensities_under_the_Different_Outdoor_Conditions/21774503?file=38638433)

## Code Files

This repository includes the following code files:

- `thesis_coding_by_Yanling_Xu.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis and visualizations.
- `thesis_coding_by_Yanling_Xu.py` - A Python script file containing the same content as the Jupyter Notebook in a different format.
